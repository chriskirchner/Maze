## Notes
Anti-alias turned off to increase performance during runtime while lightmap resolution turned down to 5 due to very long bake time.  FPS is 40-60 on Pixel depending on orientation and position. Not least, a giant teddy bear will bring you back to the beginning of the level if he touches you. Beware.
